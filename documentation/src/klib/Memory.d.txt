Memory.d

This provides the new(er) memory routines, and has some nice features improved 
over klib/memory.d

Provides:

struct Heap		a very simple heap. See xulib/node.d for the XuHeap 
				extension.
void memcpy (void* src, void* dst, uint size)	memcpy(). we have c/asm 
						replacements, but this is 
						good for now
void copy(void *src, void* dst, uint size)	see memcpy
void _d_array_bounds()		standin.
uint compare (T) (in T m1, in T m2, in uint length)	memcmp should be used 
							instead
