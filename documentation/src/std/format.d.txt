format.d

Provides sprintf-style functions.

Provides:

char[] format(char[] f, ...)		Replaces each %s in f with the 
					toString() of its corresponding 
					argument. Only works on:
						char[]
						char
						int
						uint
						float
						double
						long
						ulong
					It also does not keep track of the 
					number of %s, nor does it do any type 
					matching or formatting args (ONLY %s).
					If you have stuff left out, it means 
					you either are using the wrong type 
					(no objects!) or you're not giving 
					enough args. If it's shifted, you forgot
					an arg.
