Enfilades (an introduction)

The enfilade is a type of data structure used as an address. Like a URL, it 
addresses a document. Like an IP, it consists entirely of numbers.

Its structure is that of the Dewey Decimal System taken to extremes. It is an 
extension of Project Xanadu's "Tumbler Addressing" (which uses a slightly 
different definition of "enfilade", and now hardly mentions the word). A tumbler
is a series of 64-bit unsigned integers, separated by periods. These integers 
can be anything from 1 to 2^64. For example,
	1.7.58.79.293.9999.3.1960.555.7090
A tumbler can contain up to 2^64 of these integers. An enfilade is a series of 
up to 2^64 tumblers, separated by 0-digits. For example,
	1.27.0.1.0.2.33.1984.1570.0.2v2
The vN notation is the version. The tumbler sequence ends in a v, followed by a 
version number (once again, 64 bit). Versions start with 1, and progress 
posward. A version of 0 means the newest version.
