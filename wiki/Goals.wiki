= Goals and Objectives =

XANA should:

  * be as much in D as possible
  * test a relatively complete implementation of a relatively complete slice of xanalogical ideas
  * be as simple in implementation as possible given the previous two goals
  * not be concerned with performance or flexibility except in the form of the xanalogical portions
  * _***_ be an experiment to see if the xanalogical concepts can be implemented in the form of an OS, not for production, and a test bed for new ideas of that type _***_


Project XANA should:

  * be open to new ideas
  * look for clever solutions that save time and performance
  * look for clever new paradigms to increase flexibility
  * not be prey to the status quo
